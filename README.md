<h2>Overview<br></h2>
<p>This repository contains code to predict heart failure using the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm. It uses a dataset with various features related to heart health to classify whether a person is at risk of heart failure or not.

<h2>Introduction</h2><br>
<p>Heart failure is a serious medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early prediction of heart failure risk can be crucial for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. This project uses the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm, a probabilistic classifier, to predict heart failure risk based on a set of heart health features.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2><br>
The dataset used for training and testing the model contains various features related to heart health, including age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. Each data point in the dataset has a binary target variable, indicating whether the person had heart failure (1) or not (0).


<h2>Model and Evaluation</h2><br>
The Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm is trained on the preprocessed heart health dataset. This algorithm assumes that the features within each class are normally distributed, making it suitable for continuous feature data.To evaluate the model's performance, we use standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to predict heart failure outcomes accurately.
